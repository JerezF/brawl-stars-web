			<p class="brawler__p">Piper is an <span class="epic">Epic</span> brawler with low health but the potential to do very high damage to her targets. Her single-shot main attack does more damage the further the projectile travels, so she excels at supporting her team at range. Her Super allows her to drop grenades at her feet before jumping away from her enemies, dealing damage to enemies when the grenades explode. Her Gadget, Auto Aimer, allows her to fire 4 shots from a pistol towards the closest enemy. Her first Star Power, Ambush, allows her to do 800 extra damage at max range when she is in a bush and her second Star Power, Snappy Sniping, reloads 0.3 ammo when she hits an enemy.</p>

				<cite class="brawler__cite-attack">"Piper fires a sniper shot from the tip of her parasol. The shot gains more oompf the farther it flies!"</cite>
				<p class="attack__p">Piper shoots a single bullet from her parasol that travels very quickly. The longer the bullet travels, the more damage the bullet will inflict, so Piper is less effective against enemies near her. Piper's attack has a very slow reload speed.</p>

			<section class="super">
				<h3 class="super__title">Poppin'</h3>
				<cite class="brawler__cite-super">"Piper hops away to avoid pushy suitors. She leaves them a lady's favor though: live grenades from her garter!"</cite>
				<p class="super__p">When her Super is used, Piper will jump up into the air and throw 4 grenades below her that deal heavy damage to any enemies near them when they detonate. While in the air, Piper is completely immune to all damage besides damage applied over time. The grenades will knock Brawlers back.</p>

			<section class="gadget">
				<h3 class="gadget__title">Auto Aimer</h3>
				<cite class="brawler__cite-gadged">"Piper fires 4 quick shots at the closest enemy. Each shot deals 400 damage."</cite>
				<p class="gadget__p">Piper pulls out a pistol and fires 4 small bullets aimed towards the nearest enemy. She can still move around during this ability (and thus allows her to switch targets in the middle of her Gadget), however firing with her main attack will interrupt this ability. Each bullet hit can trigger her Snappy Sniping Star Power.</p>
			</section>
				<div class="spower-1">
					<h3 class="spower__title1">Ambush</h3>
					<cite class="brawler__cite-sp">"Piper's attack deals +800 extra damage (at max range) when she's hidden in a bush."</cite>
					<p class="spower__p1">When Piper is hidden within a bush, her main attack gains 800 bonus damage, making her already devastating shots even more deadly doing 2928 damage at max range. The bullet also gets a rainbow trail replacing the standard rings. Also, if Piper is hidden in a bush, her ammunition bar looks yellow instead of the usual orange. The sound of the shot also changes, with a somewhat layered sound of her normal shots place on top of it.</p>

				<div class="spower-2">
					<h3 class="spower__title2">Snappy Sniping</h3>
					<cite class="brawler__cite-sp2">"When Piper hits an enemy with her attack, she reloads 0.3 ammo instantly."</cite>
					<p class="spower__p2">When Piper hits an enemy, she quickly reloads 0.3 ammo, increasing her reload speed. If Piper hits opponents besides brawlers (for example, Nita's bear), it will also activate. This also includes the damage dealt from her Gadget, Auto Aimer.</p>
